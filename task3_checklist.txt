Task #3: Implement File Scanning Module - Checklist

*   [x] **3.1: Define FileScanner Class/Module Structure**
    *   [x] Create `file_scanner.py`.
    *   [x] Define `FileScanner` class with `__init__` (to accept configuration like exclusion patterns, ignored extensions).
    *   [x] Add placeholder for `scan_directory(self, root_path)` method.
    *   [x] Add placeholder for `_is_excluded(self, file_path, root_path)` method.
    *   [x] Add placeholder for `_is_binary(self, file_path)` method.
*   [x] **3.2: Implement Directory Traversal Logic** (in `scan_directory`)
    *   [x] Use `os.walk` to recursively traverse the `root_path`.
    *   [x] For each file found, construct its full path.
*   [x] **3.3: Implement File/Directory Exclusion Logic** (in `_is_excluded` and used by `scan_directory`)
    *   [x] Handle excluded directory names (e.g., `.git`, `__pycache__`, `venv`).
    *   [x] Handle excluded file names/patterns (e.g., using `fnmatch` for glob patterns like `*.log`, `temp_*`).
    *   [x] Ensure paths are normalized for consistent matching.
*   [x] **3.4: Implement Binary File Detection/Exclusion** (in `_is_binary` and used by `scan_directory`)
    *   [x] Maintain a list of common binary file extensions to exclude by default (e.g., `.pyc`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.o`, `.so`, `.dll`, `.exe`).
    *   [x] Implement a heuristic to detect binary content in files without common binary extensions (e.g., check a sample of bytes for a high proportion of null bytes or non-printable characters).
*   [x] **3.5: Integrate and Test FileScanner Module**
    *   [x] `scan_directory` should call `_is_excluded` and `_is_binary` to filter files.
    *   [x] Return a list of valid (non-excluded, non-binary) file paths.
    *   [x] Create a simple test script (e.g., in `if __name__ == '__main__':` block of `file_scanner.py` or a separate test file) to:
        *   [x] Set up a dummy directory structure with various files and subdirectories.
        *   [x] Include files that should be scanned, files to be excluded by name/pattern, binary files, and files in excluded directories.
        *   [x] Instantiate `FileScanner` with appropriate exclusion settings.
        *   [x] Call `scan_directory` and assert that the returned list of files is correct.
*   [x] **3.6: Create Unit Tests for FileScanner**
    *   [x] Create a dedicated test file (e.g., `test_file_scanner.py`) using a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.
    *   [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for:
        *   [x] Write unit tests for `_is_excluded` with various patterns and paths.
        *   [x] Write unit tests for `_is_binary` with known text and binary file samples/content.
        *   [x] Write integration tests for `scan_directory` using `pathlib` to create temporary test directory structures. (Covered by existing tests with `tempfile`)
