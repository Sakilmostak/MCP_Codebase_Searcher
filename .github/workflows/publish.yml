      # Note: This uses PyPI's Trusted Publishing mechanism.
      # You need to configure it in your PyPI account: 
      # 1. Go to PyPI > Manage your Account > Publishing
      # 2. Add a new pending publisher and select GitHub
      # 3. Enter 'Sakilmostak' for owner and 'MCP_Codebase_Searcher' for repository name
      # 4. Enter 'publish.yml' for the workflow name
      
      ## IF you prefer to use your old API Token method instead of Trusted Publishing,
