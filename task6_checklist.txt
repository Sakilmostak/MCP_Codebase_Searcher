Task #6: Implement LLM Elaboration Module (`mcp_elaborate.py`) - Checklist

*   [x] **6.1: Define `ContextAnalyzer` Class Structure**
    *   [x] Create `mcp_elaborate.py`.
    *   [x] Define `ContextAnalyzer` class.
    *   [x] `__init__(self, api_key, model_name='gemini-pro')`: Store API key, model name. Initialize Gemini client (`genai.configure`, `genai.GenerativeModel`). Handle potential initialization errors (e.g., API key not found from `config.py`).

*   [x] **6.2: Implement Core Elaboration Logic (`elaborate_on_match`)**
    *   [x] Method signature: `elaborate_on_match(self, file_path, line_number, snippet, full_file_content=None)`.
    *   [x] Craft a detailed prompt for the Gemini model. The prompt should instruct the LLM to:
        *   [x] Explain the provided code snippet in the context of the surrounding code (if `full_file_content` is provided and relevant).
        *   [x] Identify potential implications, improvements, or related concepts.
        *   [x] Focus on being helpful and concise.
        *   [x] Mention the file path and line number for context.
    *   [x] If `full_file_content` is provided, consider including relevant surrounding lines (e.g., +/- 10-20 lines around the snippet) in the prompt to give the LLM more context, instead of the whole file if it's too large.
    *   [x] Call the Gemini API (`model.generate_content(prompt)`).
    *   [x] Handle API responses: extract the generated text.
    *   [x] Implement error handling for API calls (e.g., `google.api_core.exceptions`, network issues).

*   [x] **6.3: Integrate with Configuration (`config.py`)**
    *   [x] Ensure `ContextAnalyzer` can receive the API key, potentially loaded via `config.load_api_key()` if not directly passed.

*   [x] **6.4: (Placeholder) Result Formatting/Streaming**
    *   [x] For now, return the raw text. Future tasks might involve structured output or streaming.

*   [x] **6.5: Add Basic `if __name__ == '__main__':` Test Block**
    *   [x] Load API key (e.g., from `.env` via `config.py`).
    *   [x] Instantiate `ContextAnalyzer`.
    *   [x] Create a dummy code snippet and context.
    *   [x] Call `elaborate_on_match` and print the result.
    *   [x] Handle cases where API key might be missing for local testing.

*   [x] **6.6: Update Main CLI (`mcp_searcher.py`) to Optionally Use `ContextAnalyzer`**
    *   [x] If `args.elaborate` is true:
        *   [x] Load API key.
        *   [x] Instantiate `ContextAnalyzer`.
        *   [x] After printing each search result, if elaboration is enabled and successful:
            *   [x] Call `context_analyzer.elaborate_on_match(...)`.
            *   [x] Print the elaboration.
            *   [x] Consider reading full file content for the matched file to pass to `elaborate_on_match` for better context. Handle potential file reading errors.
        *   [x] Handle errors during `ContextAnalyzer` initialization or elaboration (e.g., print a warning and continue without elaboration).

*   [x] **6.7: Manual Testing of Elaboration Feature**
    *   [x] Test `mcp_searcher.py` with the `-e` flag on a simple query.
    *   [x] Verify that elaboration output appears and is relevant.
    *   [x] Test behavior when API key is missing or invalid (if feasible to simulate safely).

*   [ ] **6.8: (Optional) Unit Tests for `ContextAnalyzer`**
    *   [ ] Mock the Gemini API calls.
    *   [ ] Test prompt generation logic.
    *   [ ] Test API response handling and error conditions.

**Status: Completed (Unit Tests Skipped).**
